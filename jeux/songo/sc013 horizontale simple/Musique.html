    <i>
      <p>
        “By the help of the Holy Spirit we are naming the album TOO FAITHFUL.

      <p>The summary is:GOD IS TOO FAITHFUL TO FAIL.</p>
      <p>
        I’m so full of boundless joy that finally my first album ever will be
        out. It’s been a long season of waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey into recording my own songs started in 2014 when my Pastor
        sent me to the studio to work on my
      </p>
      <p>
        first song “GOD IS REAL” and 7years later we have an album. Halleluyah!
